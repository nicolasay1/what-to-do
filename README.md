Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

This web application was created to unite people in search of group activities.

The logged-in user can browse through suggested activities around them, which can be filtered by distance, date, and several activity types (e.g. indoors, outdoors, sports, culture, etc.).
Proposed activities can be saved by the user by swiping right on the activity card, or can be discarded by swiping left. 

A user can create a group, and can create as many groups as they like. The group creator can invite other users ot join the group by searching their name, email, or by sending them an invitation link.

Activities seen through browsing, and saved activities, can be shared to a group. The group members can choose to attend the event invitation. The user who shared the activity to the group can confirm and book the event.


The app was coded in Ruby on Rails. The database uses postgreSQL. The front-end was coded in HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript.
